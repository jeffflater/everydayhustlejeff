        <div class="blog-post-content">
            <div class="blog-post-container">
                <p class="blog-post-intro">DoorDash was actually my first gig app. Before I tried anything else, I signed up to be a Dasher. Here's why it's still a solid choice for anyone looking to start earning extra income.</p>

                <h2>Why DoorDash First?</h2>
                <p>When I was looking for a flexible way to make extra money, DoorDash kept coming up. It's the most popular food delivery platform in the US, which means one thing: consistent orders. In most areas, you won't be sitting around waiting for deliveries.</p>

                <h2>What Makes DoorDash Different</h2>
                <p>After trying multiple delivery apps, here's what stands out about DoorDash:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Market Leader</strong> - More restaurants and more customers means more orders</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep 100% of Tips</strong> - Every tip goes straight to you, no questions</li>
                    <li><strong>Fast Pay</strong> - Cash out your earnings daily for a small $1.99 fee</li>
                    <li><strong>Scheduling Flexibility</strong> - Dash Now when it's busy, or schedule ahead</li>
                    <li><strong>Clear Earnings Display</strong> - See what you'll make before accepting</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Dasher Experience</h2>
                <p>Here's what a typical delivery looks like:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Get a delivery offer with the restaurant, drop-off distance, and payout</li>
                    <li>Accept or decline based on whether it's worth your time</li>
                    <li>Drive to the restaurant and pick up the order</li>
                    <li>Deliver to the customer (usually leave at door)</li>
                    <li>Mark complete and get your next offer</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The whole process is straightforward. The app guides you through everything.</p>

                <h2>What You Need to Start</h2>
                <p>DoorDash has some of the most accessible requirements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be at least 18 years old</li>
                    <li>Have a valid driver's license</li>
                    <li>Have access to a car, bike, or scooter</li>
                    <li>Pass a background check</li>
                    <li>Have a smartphone (iPhone or Android)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>That's it. No special vehicle requirements, no age minimums beyond 18. If you have a way to get around and a phone, you can start.</p>

                <h2>Maximizing Your Earnings</h2>
                <p>After dashing for a while, I've learned a few things:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Work meal times</strong> - Lunch (11am-1pm) and dinner (5pm-9pm) are busiest</li>
                    <li><strong>Know your zone</strong> - Learn which areas have the most restaurants</li>
                    <li><strong>Be selective</strong> - Decline low-paying orders that aren't worth your time</li>
                    <li><strong>Track your mileage</strong> - It's tax deductible</li>
                    <li><strong>Peak Pay bonuses</strong> - Extra money during busy times</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The $300 Dasher Challenge</h2>
                <p>I actually created a whole course around maximizing DoorDash earnings. It's called the $300 Dasher Challenge, and it's available inside The Everyday Hustle community. If you want to learn my strategies for hitting consistent numbers, check it out.</p>

                <h2>Ready to Start?</h2>
                <p>If you're on the fence, just try it. The signup process takes about 10 minutes, and the background check usually clears in 3-7 days. Once you're approved, you can start earning immediately.</p>
                <p>There's no commitment. No minimum hours. Just open the app when you want to work and close it when you're done.</p>
